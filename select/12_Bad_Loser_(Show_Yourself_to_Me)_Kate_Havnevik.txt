Don't be a bad loser
Pick up the pieces that you left
Don't walk away in confusion
Just dive in again

You're in a vicious circle
No-one to blame but yourself
It seems you've lost your sparkle
And your strength to move on
Do you know what you want?

Hide, and you'll be gone
And if you run, then I won't follow
You won't be alone
If you just show yourself to me
If you just show yourself to me

Don't be a sad loser
It was only a game
Your world is one big illusion
If you fall, just get up again
You could still win in the end

Hide, and you'll be gone
And if you run, then I won't follow
You won't be alone
If you just show yourself to me
If you just show yourself to me

Sleep, and I'll be gone
If you escape, then I won't find you
But you won't be alone
If you just show yourself to me

Hide, and you'll be gone
And if you run, then I won't follow
You won't be alone
If you just show yourself to me
If you just show yourself to me

If you just show yourself to me (Hide, and you'll be gone)
If you just show yourself to me (And if you run, then I won't follow)
If you just show yourself to me (You won't be alone)
If you just show yourself to me
