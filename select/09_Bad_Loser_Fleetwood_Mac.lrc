[00:18.73] Well, you thought you had a hold on me
[00:23.24] But it's different now
[00:26.55] Everything you done before
[00:29.71] Fell upon you now
[00:38.21] 
[00:33.55] Are you just a bad loser?
[00:37.28] But you never let go
[00:39.44] (And you're gonna go down)
[00:41.37] Yes, you'll go down but you'll never let it show
[01:05.37] 
[00:55.26] All the strings and the strokes in the ocean
[00:59.49] Won't buy you peace of mind
[01:02.92] All because you did what you did
[01:07.16] You're not the peaceful kind
[01:21.16] 
[01:10.68] You're just a bad loser
[01:14.06] But you never let go
[01:16.16] (And you're gonna go down)
[01:18.31] Yes, you'll go down but you'll never never let it show
[01:45.31] 
[02:01.98] I think you really know what I mean
[02:05.53] But I'll tell you one more time
[02:09.70] Oh, because it's the truth and you know it
[02:13.27] That you're no friend of mine
[02:27.77] 
[02:17.05] You're just a bad loser
[02:20.92] And you never let go
[02:22.81] (And you're gonna go down)
[02:24.86] Yes, you'll go down but you'll never never let it show
