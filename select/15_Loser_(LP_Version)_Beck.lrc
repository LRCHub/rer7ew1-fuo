[00:22.23] In the time of chimpanzees I was a monkey
[00:25.26] Butane in my veins and I'm out to cut the junkie
[00:27.76] With the plastic eyeballs, spray-paint the vegetables
[00:30.99] Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose
[00:52.49] 
[00:33.92] Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
[00:36.48] Stock car flamin' with a loser and the cruise control
[00:39.38] Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
[00:41.76] Got a couple of couches, sleep on the love-seat
[01:05.26] 
[00:44.93] Someone came in sayin' I'm insane to complain
[00:47.53] About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
[00:50.54] Don't believe everything that you breathe
[00:53.07] You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
[00:55.85] So shave your face with some mace in the dark
[00:58.89] Savin' all your food stamps and burnin' down the trailer park
[01:02.68] Yo, cut it
[01:07.68] 
[01:07.23] Soy un perdedor
[01:12.76] I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
[01:17.40] (Double-barrel buckshot)
[01:18.97] Soy un perdedor
[01:23.88] I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
[01:45.38] 
[01:29.81] Forces of evil in a bozo nightmare
[01:32.77] Ban all the music with a phony gas chamber
[01:35.20] 'Cause one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag
[01:38.35] One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag
[01:40.84] With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose-job
[02:03.34] 
[01:44.05] The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
[01:46.97] He hung himself with a guitar string
[01:49.47] A slab of turkey-neck and it's hanging from a pigeon wing
[01:52.74] You can't write if you can't relate
[01:54.77] Trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate
[01:57.67] And my time is a piece of wax falling on a termite
[02:02.18] That's choking on the splinters
[02:17.68] 
[02:03.83] Soy un perdedor
[02:08.83] I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
[02:13.18] (Get crazy with the cheeze whiz)
[02:15.06] Soy un perdedor
[02:20.02] I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
[02:24.78] (Drive-by body pierce)
[02:35.78] 
[02:30.72] Yo, bring it on down
[02:40.72] 
[02:54.36] (I'm a driver, I'm a winner)
[02:56.90] (Things are gonna change I can feel it)
[03:16.40] 
[02:59.97] Soy un perdedor
[03:05.03] I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
[03:10.06] (I can't believe you)
[03:11.26] Soy un perdedor
[03:16.41] I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
[03:37.91] 
[03:22.39] Soy un perdedor
[03:27.63] I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
[03:32.02] (Sprechen Sie deutsch, baby?)
[03:33.67] Soy un perdedor
[03:38.72] I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
[03:43.43] (Know what I'm sayin'?)
